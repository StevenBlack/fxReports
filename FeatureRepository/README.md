# fxReports / Feature Repository

**Repository of reporting features provided by the FoxPro Community**

Project Manager: [Cathy Pountney](https://github.com/frontier2000)

**NOTE TO CONSUMERS**

Each contributor provides all the individual files in a subfolder (named after themselves.) In addition, an all-inclusive zip file is  provided. Either download the zip file or the individual files, but not both. Use the Unwrap & Share utility (located in the CoreFramework folder) to process files you download.

**NOTE TO CONTRIBUTORS**

Each developer who contributes reporting features has a uniquely named folder (named after themselves). Use the Wrap & Share Utility (located in the CoreFramework folder) to prepare your files and then upload them to your subfolder. Note that within your folder, the following subfolders may exist:

* code
* samples
* docs
* data (mandatory)

Upload the .ZIP file to the FeatureRepository folder.

Update the TOC.md file to describe each of the features you provide.

*NOTE: I'm preparing this framework and utilities as a presentation scheduled for [Southwest Fox 2019](www.swfox.net). Look for more to come soon.*
