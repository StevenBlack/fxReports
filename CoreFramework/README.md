# fxReports - Core Framework

**The core framework code for fxReports**

Project Manager: [Cathy Pountney](https://github.com/frontier2000)

Either download the fxReports_CoreFramework.zip file or download all the other files.

Run the fxReports form to learn how to use custom report features.

*NOTE: I'm preparing this framework and utilities as a presentation scheduled for [Southwest Fox 2019](www.swfox.net). Look for more to come soon.*
