# fxReports / Features folder
<b>Reporting features provided by the FoxPro Community</b><br><br>
Project Manager: [Cathy Pountney](https://github.com/frontier2000)<br>

<b>NOTE TO CONSUMERS</b><br>
Some contributors provide individual files as well as a .ZIP file. If a .ZIP file exists, you do not need to download all the other individual files. The .ZIP file should include all the other files. Use the Unwrap & Share utility (located in the CoreFramework folder) to process files you download. 

<b>NOTE TO CONTRIBUTORS</b><br>
Each developer who contributes reporting features has a uniquely named folder (probably their name). Use the Wrap & Share Utility (located in the CoreFramework folder) to prepare your files and then upload them here. Note that within your folder, the following subfolders may exist:
<ul>
<li>code</li>
<li>samples</li>
<li>docs</li>
<li>data</li>
</ul>

Optionally, you may upload a single .ZIP file to your folder which contains all your files. Be sure the zip file organizes the files within the same 4 subfolders listed above.

<i>NOTE: I'm preparing this framework and utilities as a presentation scheduled for [Southwest Fox 2019](www.swfox.net). Look for more to come soon.<i>
